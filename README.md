Music genre classification is a fundamental task in Music Information Retrieval (MIR) with applications ranging from recommendation systems to content organization.
In this code, we explore deep learning techniques for music genre classification, focusing on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Modal-based models, and Training-based models. 
The widely used GTZAN dataset is employed for experimentation.

Through this process I found that the transfer learning-based model has performed best among all three models
